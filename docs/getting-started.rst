Getting started
===============

This project is a collection of:

* a simulation model of a simple patient flow network
* machinery for conducting simulation experiments
* machinery for fitting, assessing and using simulation metamodels

We are providing this project repository as a way being fully transparent
in terms of all of the steps of our research project.

Our paper is in the final stages of preparation and will be under review soon.
