Simio model design
==================

Arrival streams
---------------

There are six arrival streams – four of which are random arrivals and two are scheduled. Let’s build the random arrival streams first. 

Random arrival streams
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The four random arrival streams and their associated Source nodes are:

* spontaneous labor (`Spont_Labor`)
* urgent induction (`Urg_Ind`)
* non-delivered to LD (`NonDeliv_LD`)
* non-delivered to PP (`NonDeliv_PP`)

Ea
We want to be able to run the model with either stationary or non-stationary arrivals. 

Stationary arrivals
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Set the Arrival Mode property of the `Spont_Labor` Source node to Interarrival Time and you'll see that the Interarrrival Time property is set to Random.Exponential(168.0/SpontLabor_AvgPerWeek)




Each random arrival stream gets its own Source object.





 and a Model Property defining the average volume per week. 
In addition, the branching probabilities are implemented as Model Properties.


Different entity types with different processing times and graphics
-------------------------------------------------------------------
Since multiple patient types 
will visit the same Server objects (e.g. post-partum unit) and will have different LOS distributions, we need to 
have a general approach to managing different parameters for different patient types. In Simio, the easiest way to 
do this is through a Data Table (Chapter 7). Tables can contain any number of columns and the allowable data types includes a 
wide variety of Standard Properties, Element References or Object References. Once the table is created, it can be 
referenced in a variety of ways (p219) in the model. Row selection from tables can be done randomly based 
on user specified probabilities or some rule. Often each entity will simply be referencing a specific row every time. 
Simio provides an easy way to implement this by setting a Table Reference Assignment in the Source object.
