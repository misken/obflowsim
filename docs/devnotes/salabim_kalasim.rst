salabim and kalasim
====================

Salabim is Python based DES. SimPy is event based but salabim says
that it is activity and time slice based.

Salabim has built in features that might be quite useful:

* trace
* monitors
* animation

Salabim is implemented in one giant salabim.py file. Not a ton
of commenting.


kalasim is a rewrite of salabim (different author) but written in Kotlin.
Even though it's not written in Python, its design and architecture could be
useful.
