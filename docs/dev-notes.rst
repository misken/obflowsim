Development notes
==================

Check out Allen Downey's ModSimPy project - https://github.com/misken/ModSimPy (I forked it already).

See https://py-pkgs.org/04-package-structure#including-data-in-a-package for 
instructions on including sample data in the distributed package.

Consider creating a cookie cutter to lay out a simulation analysis 
folder structure with sample files.

See ns3 for ideas on input file segregation.
