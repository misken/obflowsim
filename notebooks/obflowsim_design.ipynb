    "Within SimPy, modeling Poisson arrivals can be done with a loop that keeps generating `Timeout` events with exponential inter-event times until one of the stopping conditions is met.\n",

    "As implemented, the `PatientPoissonArrivals` class is **not** a general Poisson arrival generator object that can be reused without modifying the source code. It is tightly coupled to both the type of entity object being created (`Patient`) and the system object to which the entity arrives (`PatientFlowSystem`). The current design is transparent and was easy to create, but we should be able to come up with a way for a general Poisson arrival object to broadcast a signal that a new arrival has occured and that some other object (i.e. the system object) can detect and respond. The signal would need to contain all relevant information needed by the system object to create the new entity instance and route it into the flow system."
