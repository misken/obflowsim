obflowsim
==============================

The obflowsim Python package is a discrete event simulation model built with
SimPy of a very simple inpatient obstetrical patient flow network. In
addition to the DES model there are modules for related simulation
input and output data processing including fitting of metamodels. The 
obflowsim package was developed as part of a research project involving
comparison of simulation metamodeling methods and the impact of feature
engineering on metamodel accuracy.
