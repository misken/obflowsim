# obflowsim - a flexible obstetric patient flow simulation model in Python

**IMPORTANT** The OB patient flow simulation metamodeling research project formerly residing in this repo has
moved to its new home at [obflowsim-mm](https://github.com/misken/obflowsim-mm).

## Overview

This project is intended to provide a way to simulate OB patient flow
systems in Python. The model is based on the [SimPy](https://simpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) 
package and is designed to be flexible and data driven. The first version
of this model was developed for a simulation metamodeling research project 
(paper currently under review) and we have moved that repo to 
[obflowsim-mm](https://github.com/misken/obflowsim-mm). This obflowsim
repo is the home for continued development of the core discrete event
simulation (DES) model. Active development is happening on the `develop`
branch whereas the `main` branch contains the original simplified 
model used in the research project.
